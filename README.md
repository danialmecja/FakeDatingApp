# FakeDatingApp

The fake dating app is a project that my team and I were assigned to carry out for our Data Structures course in our 2nd semester of university. 

# Objective and Aim
The objective and aim of this program is to simulate an actual dating app (at best) but with a couple of features that would make it an app that would steer people away from using it. Hence, the "Fake" in the title.

# Features
There are a number of nifty features that allow this app to simulate actual dating apps on the market.
- User Signup
  - Allows users to create a `FriendZoneUser` account to be able to login and start searching for your matches
- Login authentication
  - Allows users to ogin with an existing dating account button `Tinder/Tantan` and a create a new account button that will allow the user to have the choices. 
  - In profile creation, the program will get the parameters entered by the user and store the data in a text file with all the userData. 
  - In login, the program will receive the username and password input by the user and trace back in the .txt file for matching user credentials in order to log in the app.
- Soothing "Dating App Vibe" Music in the home screen
- A search feature to find your future significant other
- A chat feature to speak with your matches
  - The chat feature has a "troll message" feature which I would not want to spoil here in this description
- A solid encryption system to encrypt and save texts you have with your matches
